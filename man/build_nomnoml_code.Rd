\description{
This functions builds the nomnoml code to render from the data built by
\code{flow_data()}. It's not very useful for the average user to call it directly
but its arguments can be set through \code{flow_view()} so their definitions are useful.
}
\details{
All arguments, with the exception of \code{data} and \code{code}, are
nomnoml directives, enumerated at https://openbase.io/js/nomnoml/documentation .

Some of those don't seem to do anything in the context of this package,
but given the sparsity of nomnoml documentation, we
decided to keep all of them for more flexibility.
