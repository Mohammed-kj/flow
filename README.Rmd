*{flow}* provides tools to visualize as flow diagrams the logic of functions, 
expressions or scripts and ease debugging.

Use cases are : 

* Deciphering other people's code
* Getting more comfortable with our own code by easing a visual understanding of its structure
* Documentation
* Debugging
* Inspect unit test results
* Providing a higher level view of an algorithm to collaborators
* Education

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("moodymudskipper/flow")
```
## Example

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(flow)
```

Using default nomnoml engine

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flow_view(rle)
```

![nomnoml](man/figures/README_nomnoml.png)

Using plantuml engine (make sure the [{plantuml}](https://github.com/rkrug/plantuml) package is installed).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flow_view(rle, engine = "plantuml")
```

![plantuml](man/figures/README_plantuml.png)

## Notes

Make sure to check the vignettes for a detailed breakdown of all features.


*{flow}* is built on top of Javier Luraschi's *{nomnoml}* package, and 
Rainer M Krug 's *{plantuml}* package, the latter only available from 
[github](https://github.com/rkrug/plantuml)
at the moment.
