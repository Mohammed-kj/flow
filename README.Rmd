*{flow}* provides tools to visualize as flow diagrams the logic of functions, 
expressions or scripts and ease debugging.

Use cases are : 

* Deciphering other people's code
* Getting more comfortable with our own code by easing a visual understanding of its structure
* Documentation
* Debugging
* Providing a higher level view of an algorithm to collaborator
* Education

## Installation

Install with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("moodymudskipper/flow")
```
## Example

```{r, eval=TRUE}
library(flow)
```

Using default nomnoml engine

```{r, eval=TRUE}
flow_view(rle)
```

Using plantuml engine (make sure the [{plantuml}](https://github.com/rkrug/plantuml) package is installed).

```{r, eval=TRUE}
flow_view(rle, engine = "plantuml")
```

at the moment ("rkrug/plantuml").
